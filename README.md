# 🌱 Carbon Bazaar

**Carbon Bazaar** is a digital carbon credit trading platform designed to support **India’s upcoming Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)** by creating an inclusive, transparent, and scalable carbon marketplace.  
It bridges the gap between **industries seeking carbon credits** and **Indian farmers capable of generating them through climate-positive agricultural practices**.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

India’s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) will mandate nearly **800 entities across 9 sectors** to meet emission reduction targets through carbon credit trading by 2026.

However:
- Industrial demand for carbon credits is rising rapidly
- Indian farmers remain largely **excluded from the carbon economy**
- Existing solutions are fragmented, intermediary-driven, and non-transparent
- Carbon credit generation processes are complex and inaccessible for small farmers

Without farmer inclusion, the carbon market risks becoming **industry-centric, supply-constrained, and socially disconnected**.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Carbon Bazaar** provides a unified digital platform that:

- Enables **businesses** to buy verified, traceable carbon credits
- Empowers **farmers** to generate and sell carbon credits through sustainable practices
- Uses **AI-driven guidance** to simplify awareness, onboarding, and decision-making
- Aligns **climate compliance, rural income generation, and sustainability**

The platform functions as a **two-sided marketplace** with trust, transparency, and inclusivity at its core.

## ✨ Unique Selling Points (USP)

- Farmers treated as **active market participants**, not beneficiaries
- Integrated **carbon trading + farmer enablement** in one ecosystem
- AI used for **education, awareness, and decision support**
